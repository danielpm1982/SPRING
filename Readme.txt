Must add Spring framework jars at the lib directory (and add them to the classpath of each project) for the projects' code to run. And perform a cleanning on the Server and on each project (rebuilding each one), if needed. No Spring, or any other libraries, nor any previous projects' builds, included. Instead, all needed jars can be found at the one and only directory repository: SpringJars. Just copy these content jars to the lib directory, at each project, and rebuild the project, if you wish. Then it will run on any JVM running Java8+.
