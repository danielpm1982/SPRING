This Repository includes basic JAVA SE Console and JAVA EE Web Spring Projects (SpringCore, SpringMVC, Spring AOP) with Hibernate/JPA/MySQL. Must add Spring framework jars at the lib directory (and add them to the classpath of each project) for the projects' code to run. And perform a clean on the Server and on each project (rebuilding each one), if needed. No Spring, or any other libraries, nor any previous projects' builds, included on indvidual projects. Instead, all needed jars can be found at the one and only directory repository: SpringJars. Just copy these content jars to the lib directory, at each project, and rebuild the project, if you wish. MAVEN is not used here. For Spring JPA Projects using MAVEN, including not only SpringCore, SpringMVC and SpringAOP but also Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring REST and SpringBoot, and other integrated technologies, see the other Spring repositories at: https://github.com/danielpm1982/SPRING2 and https://github.com/danielpm1982/SPRING3. JAVA8+ compatible.
